Alison Yim's CSE Independent Study Project Fall '23- Spring '24

The two main folders are for:
1. Blender assets in .blend that you can import into blender and then export from Blender as any type of file (e.g. fbx of glb)
2. Python scripts that aggregate and analyze the survey results I collected for the data displayed in my app. Each script reads the original xlsx file for the results of the survey Google Forms, defines the count of responses for each question option and then categorizes it, and then exports to a new xlsx file for the now cleaned data
